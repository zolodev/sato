# sato
Satō pronounced [saꜜtoː], English: /ˈsɑːtoʊ/ SAH-toh) translates to Sugar.

Inspired by and a big shout out to [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) project [Kohi](https://kohiengine.com/)

Reason for me not forking or cloning the existing project Kohi, is to learn and tweak the code myself.
This is to learn C and somewhat how others start a C project and also to learn about game engines in general.
